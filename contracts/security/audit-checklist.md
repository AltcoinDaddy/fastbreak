# FastBreak Smart Contract Security Audit Checklist

## Overview
This document outlines the security audit preparation for FastBreak smart contracts deployed on the Flow blockchain. It includes comprehensive checks for common vulnerabilities and Flow-specific security considerations.

## Contract Files to Audit

### Core Contracts
- `contracts/cadence/FastBreakController.cdc` - Main controller contract
- `contracts/cadence/SafetyControls.cdc` - Safety and emergency controls
- `contracts/cadence/TradeAnalytics.cdc` - Trade analytics and reporting

### Supporting Contracts
- `contracts/cadence/UserStrategy.cdc` - User strategy management
- `contracts/cadence/BudgetManager.cdc` - Budget and spending controls

## Security Audit Categories

### 1. Access Control and Authorization

#### Checks Required:
- [ ] Verify proper access control modifiers on all public functions
- [ ] Ensure only authorized accounts can call administrative functions
- [ ] Check for proper capability-based security implementation
- [ ] Validate resource ownership checks before operations
- [ ] Verify multi-signature requirements for critical operations

#### Critical Functions to Review:
```cadence
// FastBreakController.cdc
pub fun updateUserStrategy(strategy: UserStrategy)
pub fun executeTrade(tradeParams: TradeParameters)
pub fun emergencyPause()
pub fun updateBudgetLimits(limits: BudgetLimits)

// SafetyControls.cdc
pub fun pauseContract()
pub fun unpauseContract()
pub fun addAuthorizedAccount(account: Address)
pub fun removeAuthorizedAccount(account: Address)
```

### 2. Resource Management and Ownership

#### Checks Required:
- [ ] Verify proper resource creation and destruction patterns
- [ ] Ensure resources cannot be duplicated or lost
- [ ] Check for proper resource ownership transfers
- [ ] Validate resource storage and retrieval mechanisms
- [ ] Ensure proper cleanup of temporary resources

#### Resource Types to Review:
- User strategy resources
- Trade execution resources
- Budget limit resources
- Analytics data resources

### 3. Integer Overflow and Underflow Protection

#### Checks Required:
- [ ] Verify all arithmetic operations use safe math
- [ ] Check for potential overflow in price calculations
- [ ] Validate underflow protection in balance operations
- [ ] Ensure proper bounds checking on all numeric inputs
- [ ] Review percentage calculations for precision issues

#### Critical Calculations:
```cadence
// Price calculations
let totalCost = momentPrice * quantity
let profitLoss = currentValue - purchasePrice
let budgetRemaining = dailyLimit - spentToday

// Percentage calculations
let roi = (currentValue - initialValue) / initialValue * 100.0
let confidenceScore = factors.reduce(0.0, fun(acc, factor): UFix64 { acc + factor.weight })
```

### 4. Reentrancy Protection

#### Checks Required:
- [ ] Verify no external calls in the middle of state changes
- [ ] Ensure proper checks-effects-interactions pattern
- [ ] Validate that state is updated before external calls
- [ ] Check for potential recursive call vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review callback mechanisms for reentrancy risks

### 5. Input Validation and Sanitization

#### Checks Required:
- [ ] Verify all function parameters are properly validated
- [ ] Check for null/nil parameter handling
- [ ] Ensure proper bounds checking on all inputs
- [ ] Validate string inputs for length and content
- [ ] Check for proper address validation

#### Input Validation Examples:
```cadence
pub fun updateBudgetLimit(newLimit: UFix64) {
    pre {
        newLimit > 0.0: "Budget limit must be positive"
        newLimit <= 1000000.0: "Budget limit too high"
    }
    // Implementation
}

pub fun setStrategy(strategy: UserStrategy) {
    pre {
        strategy.type != nil: "Strategy type required"
        strategy.parameters.count > 0: "Strategy parameters required"
    }
    // Implementation
}
```

### 6. Emergency Controls and Circuit Breakers

#### Checks Required:
- [ ] Verify emergency pause functionality works correctly
- [ ] Ensure paused state prevents all critical operations
- [ ] Check that emergency functions are properly protected
- [ ] Validate recovery mechanisms after emergency pause
- [ ] Review automatic circuit breaker triggers

### 7. Event Logging and Monitoring

#### Checks Required:
- [ ] Verify all critical operations emit appropriate events
- [ ] Check that events contain sufficient information for monitoring
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data is not exposed in events
- [ ] Validate event parameter types and structures
- [ ] Review event emission patterns for consistency

#### Critical Events:
```cadence
pub event TradeExecuted(userId: Address, momentId: UInt64, price: UFix64, timestamp: UFix64)
pub event BudgetLimitExceeded(userId: Address, attemptedAmount: UFix64, remainingBudget: UFix64)
pub event EmergencyPauseActivated(reason: String, timestamp: UFix64)
pub event SuspiciousActivityDetected(userId: Address, activity: String, timestamp: UFix64)
```

### 8. Gas Optimization and DoS Prevention

#### Checks Required:
- [ ] Review loops for potential gas limit issues
- [ ] Check for unbounded array operations
- [ ] Verify efficient storage patterns
- [ ] Ensure operations can complete within gas limits
- [ ] Review batch operation implementations

### 9. Upgrade and Migration Safety

#### Checks Required:
- [ ] Verify contract upgrade mechanisms are secure
- [ ] Check for proper data migration patterns
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility where required
- [ ] Validate upgrade authorization controls
- [ ] Review rollback capabilities

### 10. Flow-Specific Security Considerations

#### Checks Required:
- [ ] Verify proper use of Flow's capability-based security
