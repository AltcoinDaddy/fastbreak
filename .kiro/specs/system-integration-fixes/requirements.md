# System Integration Fixes Requirements

## Introduction

The FastBreak system has well-implemented individual services but critical integration issues preventing the system from functioning as a whole. The primary blockers are database layer export issues, missing package dependencies, and service-to-service communication failures that need immediate resolution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Layer Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all services to successfully import and use the database layer, so that the system can persist and retrieve data consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services import DatabaseManager from @fastbreak/database THEN the import succeeds without compilation errors
2. WHEN services import repository classes THEN all repository methods are properly typed and accessible
3. WHEN the database package builds THEN it compiles without TypeScript errors
4. WHEN services initialize database connections THEN they can successfully connect and perform operations

### Requirement 2: Package Dependencies Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all package dependencies to be properly resolved, so that services can build and run without missing module errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services import @fastbreak/monitoring THEN the package is found and imports succeed
2. WHEN services import @fastbreak/types THEN all type definitions are available
3. WHEN running npm install in any service THEN all dependencies resolve successfully
4. WHEN building any service THEN no missing module errors occur

### Requirement 3: Service Integration Layer

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all services to communicate properly with each other, so that the complete trading workflow functions end-to-end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API Gateway starts THEN it can route requests to all backend services
2. WHEN services need to communicate THEN they use proper service discovery and error handling
3. WHEN a service fails THEN other services handle the failure gracefully
4. WHEN the system starts THEN all services initialize in the correct order with proper health checks

### Requirement 4: Runtime Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment configuration and startup scripts, so that the system can run in development and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the development environment THEN all services start with proper configuration
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN services provide clear error messages
3. WHEN using Docker Compose THEN all services start and can communicate
4. WHEN running tests THEN the test environment is properly isolated

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring, so that I can identify and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in any service THEN they are logged with proper context and correlation IDs
2. WHEN services fail to start THEN clear error messages indicate the root cause
3. WHEN services are running THEN health check endpoints return accurate status
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN appropriate alerts are generated
