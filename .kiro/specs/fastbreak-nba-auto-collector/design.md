# FastBreak Design Document

## Overview

FastBreak is a sophisticated dApp that combines AI-powered market analysis with automated trading execution on the Flow blockchain. The system architecture follows a microservices pattern with clear separation between the frontend dashboard, AI analysis engine, blockchain interaction layer, and real-time monitoring components.

The design leverages Flow's unique multi-role architecture and resource-oriented programming model through Cadence smart contracts, while integrating with Forte's Agent and Action framework for automated execution. The system prioritizes security, transparency, and user control while providing intelligent automation for NBA Top Shot moment trading.
