# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The FastBreak database layer has TypeScript compilation errors that prevent the risk management service from properly accessing database repositories. The BudgetManager service cannot access `this.db.budgetLimits` because the database package fails to compile due to type mismatches and missing properties in repository implementations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database package to compile successfully, so that all services can properly access database repositories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database package is built THEN it SHALL compile without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN services import DatabaseManager THEN they SHALL have access to all repository properties
3. WHEN the emergency-stop repository is updated THEN it SHALL use correct type definitions for update operations
4. WHEN the seed data is created THEN it SHALL match the expected StrategyParameters interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a risk management service, I want to access budget limits and spending tracker repositories, so that I can manage user budgets and track spending.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BudgetManager calls `this.db.budgetLimits.findByUserId()` THEN it SHALL return budget limits data
2. WHEN BudgetManager calls `this.db.spendingTracker.findByUserId()` THEN it SHALL return spending tracker data
3. WHEN BudgetManager calls `this.db.riskAlerts.createRiskAlert()` THEN it SHALL create risk alerts
4. WHEN BudgetManager calls `this.db.emergencyStops.createEmergencyStop()` THEN it SHALL create emergency stop records

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent type definitions across the database layer, so that there are no type mismatches between repositories and services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN EmergencyStop types are used THEN they SHALL be consistent between repository and service layers
2. WHEN StrategyParameters are defined THEN they SHALL include all required properties for each strategy type
3. WHEN repository update methods are called THEN they SHALL accept the correct parameter types
4. WHEN database entities are mapped THEN they SHALL use consistent property names and types
